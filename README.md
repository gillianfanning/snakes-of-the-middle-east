Overview
----------
This repository contains work from my independent study project "Snakes of the Middle East" undertaken during my senior year at Virginia Commonwealth University as part of the BNFO 592 course (Spring 2023).
The project aimed to explore the diversity of snake species in the Middle East, analyze their unique characteristics, and develop tools for their identification.

Project Objectives
----------
Develop familiarity with the common snake species found in the Middle East.
Design and implement digital tools to assist in the identification of snake species based on their characteristics.
Perform statistical analyses to visualize and interpret data for a scientific research paper.

Tools and Methods
----------
1. FileMaker Pro
   - Co-developed an application to assess and catalog the characteristics of snake species.
3. Excel:
   - Designed an identification tool to classify snake species based on key traits.
4. R:
   - Conducted statistical analyses on species data.
   - Produced figures and visualizations for inclusion in a scientific research paper.

Files in the Repository
---------
R Scripts: Code used for statistical analyses and figure generation.
Data Files: Sample datasets used for analysis and testing the ID tool.
Presentation: Given at the end of the Independent Study

Results
----------
The project highlighted significant trends and insights about snake diversity in the Middle East, contributing to the broader understanding of their ecological and morphological characteristics.
The tools and analyses developed through this project serve as a foundation for future work in species identification and biodiversity research.
